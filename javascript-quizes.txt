Quiz-1
Write an expression that uses at least 3 different arithmetic operators.
The expression should equal 42.
Hint: +, -, *, /, and % are possible arithmetic operators

Code:
// this expression equals 4, change it to equal 42
console.log(1 + 5 - 2 + 38);
console.log(80/2 +10 -8);
console.log(2%4 +40);

Output:
42
42
42

Quiz-2
To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, you can use the following formula:

F=CÃ—1.8+32

Code:
var celsius = 12;
var fahrenheit = celsius* 1.8 + 32;

console.log(fahrenheit);

Output:
53.6

Quiz-3
Create a string with the name of your favorite food. The first letter of the string should be capitalized.

Code:
console.log("Pizza");

Output:
Pizza

Quiz-4
Fix the right side expression so it evaluates to true.

"ALL Strings are CrEaTeD equal" == "All STRINGS are CrEaTED Equal"

Code:
var answer = "ALL Strings are CrEaTeD equal" == "ALL Strings are CrEaTeD equal";
console.log(answer);

Output:
True

Quiz-5
Build a single string that resembles the following joke.

Why couldn't the shoes go out and play?
They were all "tied" up!

Code:
var joke = "Why couldn't the shoes go out and play? \n They were all \"tied\" up!";
console.log(joke);

Output:
Why couldn't the shoes go out and play?
 They were all "tied" up!

 Quiz-6
 Build a string using concatenation by combining the lines from this famous haiku poem by Yosa Buson.

Blowing from the west
Fallen leaves gather
In the east.

Code:
var haiku = "Blowing from the west\n" + "Fallen leaves gather\n" + "In the east." ;
console.log(haiku);

Output:
Blowing from the west
Fallen leaves gather
In the east.

Quiz-7
Define two variables called thingOne and thingTwo and assign them values.
Print the values of both variables in one console.log statement using concatenation.
For example - red blue
where "red" is the value of thingOne and "blue" is the value of thingTwo.

Code:
var thingOne="red"; var thingTwo="blue";
console.log(thingOne + thingTwo);

Output:
red blue

Quiz-8
Create a variable called fullName and assign it your full name as a string.

Code:
var fullName = "anum sharma";

Output:
NA

Quiz-9
Create a variable called bill and assign it the result of 10.25 + 3.99 + 7.15
Next, create a variable called tip and assign it the result of multiplying bill by a 15% tip
rate. Finally, add the bill and tip together and store it into a variable called total.
Print the total to the JavaScript console.

To use toFixed() pass it the number of decimal points you want to use.
For example, if total equals 3.9860, then total.toFixed(2) would return 3.99.

Code:
var bill = 10.25 + 3.99 + 7.15;
var tip = 0.15 * bill;
var total = tip + bill;
console.log("$"+ total.toFixed(2));

Output:
$24.60

Quiz-10
Mad Libs is a word game where players have fun substituting words for blanks in a story.
For this exercise, use the adjective variables below to fill in the blanks
and complete the following message.

"The Intro to JavaScript course is __________. James and Julia are so __________.
I cannot wait to work through the rest of this __________ content!"
var adjective1 = "amazing";
var adjective2 = "fun";
var adjective3 = "entertaining";
Assign the resulting string to a variable called madLib.

Code:
var adjective1 = "amazing";
var adjective2 = "fun";
var adjective3 = "entertaining";

// your code goes here

var madLib = "The Intro to JavaScript course is " + adjective1 + ". James and Julia are so " + adjective2 + ". I cannot wait to work through the rest of this " + adjective3 +" content!";
console.log(madLib);

Output:
The Intro to JavaScript course is amazing. James and Julia are so fun. I cannot wait to work through the rest of this entertaining content!

Quiz-11
Here is an awesome messages:

"Hi, my name is Julia. I love cats. In my spare time, I like to play video games."

Declare and assign values to three variables for each part of the sentence that changes
 (firstName, interest, and hobby).
Use your variables and string concatenation to create your own awesome message
and store it in an awesomeMessage variable.
Finally, print your awesome message to the JavaScript console.

Code:
var firstName = "Julia";
var interest = "cats";
var hobby = "play video games";

var awesomeMessage = "Hi, my name is "+ firstName + "." + " I love " + interest + "." +  " In my spare time, I like to "+ hobby + ".";
console.log(awesomeMessage);

Output:
Hi, my name is Julia. I love cats. In my spare time, I like to play video games.
